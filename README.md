I didn't write this exercise or prepare these materials, but it's very similar to the one described [here](http://www.computedstyle.com/2010/12/hiring-front-end-engineers.html).

Instructions
============

* The wireframe below demonstrates all the necessary UI elements. The arrow images can be found in the images directory.
* Must include at least 10 images, with 5 viewable at any given moment.
* To get the image urls...
    * Hit https://t23-pics.herokuapp.com/pics for an array of image ids
    * Hit https://t23-pics.herokuapp.com/pics/{id} to get each image's url
* Clicking the left and right arrows should shift the images incrementally.
* When the user has reached the start or end point, the photos should loop as a carousel would.
* Please code the page according to industry best practices and organize the assets as you would if delivering it to a client to integrate (not necessarily to deploy).
* Use git and send us a link to the repository (Github, Bitbucket, etc...)
* Your submission will be judged on both code quality and user experience.
